HOW IT WORKS:

Client Screen Opens 
-Prompts user to input name.
-When click "submit name," client...
1. connects to server


Server...
-Waits for clients to connect.
-When client connects, stores the name & ip.
-Sends client a message, letting him know what number he is.
-When three clients are connected, send them a message that game is starting.
-Structure of server is as follows

-SERVER creates DECK
-Used DECK to create PLAYERS and POOL
-Passes PLAYERS and POOL to clients, for them to create their GUI...
-CLIENTS set the Players and the Pool

-THEN, SERVER sets PERMISSIONS
-Player[0] gets TRUE
-Everyone else gets FALSE

-BEGIN TURN and CONTINUE buttons send a message...
<CONTINUE> <CURRENTPLAYER>
When server receives this, it sends out PERMISSIONS -
CURRENT receives TRUE
E/O else receives FALSE
When clients receive their PERMISSION, TRUE sets DropdownMenu to visible,
FALSE sets DropdownMenu to invisible.

<BEGINTURN> <PLAYERTOASK> <NUMPLAYER>
Server gets this and sends it out to everyone.
When client receives this, starts a new PlayerTurnThread and passes it this info.

-REPAINT method of the client must
-DISABLE all the CardButtons of other players
-Each GameFrame must keep track of an int -- "ME"
